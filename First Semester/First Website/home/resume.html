        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Hello, welcome to my resume page. I like to think of myself as a
          pragmatic yet empathetic individual. I like to create things, solve
          problems, and learn new concepts and experiences. I feel that having a
          firm understanding of peoples from all walks of life is an important
          key to success and helping progress society as a whole. Philosophy and
          its role in structuring logic and belief is also an interest of mine.
