          <p>My name is Kc Poland and I was born in Brownwood, Texas on October 23rd, 1994. I attended high school at Brownwood High School and graduated a year early. Since then, I have worked in several different spaces including pharmacy and marketing as well as simpler jobs in retail and food service. As far as family goes, I am close with my mother and my cousin. <br><br> Currently, I am working toward an applied science degree in Computer Programming Technology. I did not enter college right after high school as I thought it would be prudent to understand what type of job I would want before I decided to pay for college. Now, I have an idea of what I want for the future. I have never been married.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Since I was a child, I always adored video games, music, and literature. As an adult I still do. Throughout high school I made over 100 songs utilizing the program GarageBand, some of them original songs and some of them remixes of existing songs. I also have an interest in theater, as I did a lot of stage acting throughout high school. I was voted "Most Likely to Appear on American Idol" in my graduating class' yearbook. <br><br>I have both a creative side and an intellectual side that I sometimes struggle to reconcile with each other. I have since decided that programming will help me explore both of these aspects of myself in an effective manner. I hope to utilize this degree to explore my interests in technology and my need to create literature, music, and even video games of my own. I have also recently gotten into <a class="content_link" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/5374229" target="_blank" rel="external" title="Kleidium's profile on nexusmods.com">modding</a>.</p>
